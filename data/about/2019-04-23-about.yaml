description: "Hi everyone! I'm Federica Piccinini.
<br />
<br />
I grew up in a little town in Italy and I've always loved learning languages. This is why I studied English, Spanish and French at a language high school and got a degree in Foreign Languages at the University of Bologna (studying Spanish and Arabic). I spent my last university year on Erasmus in Madrid, where I definitely fell in love with Spanish language and culture.
<br />
<br />
After graduating, I went back to Spain and settled in the Southern region of Andalusia, where I spent the following year. In that period I've been gaining experience as a translator working on different projects: some medical researches, online articles and blog posts for the websites Tuts+ and One Month.
<br />
<br />
Currently, I'm still collaborating with One Month to get their posts translated into Spanish and I'm looking for new challenging projects to test and improve my skills."
